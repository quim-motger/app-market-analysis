The most significant event raised by these reviews is the inability of users to create accounts on the Hive Social app. Many users reported encountering issues during the sign-up process, whether it was with email registration, phone number registration, or both. The reviews mention that despite following the required steps and meeting the criteria, the app would not proceed to the next step, and some users even received notifications stating that their device was blocked due to unusual activity. This recurring problem of not being able to create an account seems to be the most prominent issue mentioned in the reviews.
