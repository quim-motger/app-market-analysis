LOVE it!!!
Good social app.
"Edited my review back up to 4 stars. Super happy that with recent updates video progress is now bookmarked where if it is interrupted it resumes my place. I begged for that for awhile, so THANK YOU SO MUCH Gettr! There seems to be a glitch where all my favorite livestreams don't always show up in the livestream area, but missing episodes are easily found on the creator's direct page. Would ne nice to be able to subscribe to specific livestreams to appear in notifications."
