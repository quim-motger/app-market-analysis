Twitter has become so much more inclusive to Conservatives and has rejected censorship from the those who would seek to shut down free speech ! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 God Bless The U.S.A.
I really enjoy using Twitter

"I have been using Twitter for 14yrs, its also one of the only Social Media platforms I use. In recent months, there have been alot more ads in my feed than before, which is annoying. I am not impressed that my options have changed, i.e., 2 step security, you now have to pay for it. I still like it and use it but its changed alot, some days i wonder about walking away from this one too."

Elon musk for the win. For humanity
Twitter keeps me informed of today's news.
Best experience
Best app in the world for me
"Elon is a cool guy, trying to level the playing field. With 80% of Twitter's workforce gone, it's still a problem weeding out employees who hate free speech. I'd gladly pay $19.99 a month if he can stop their shadow banning of conservative voices. 93 % of America's public is traditional, non-extrewmist, straight, and family oriented. That's 309 million of us. Over 2.7 Billion Dollar's A Month in potential increased revenue to our populist champion, the great and super bright, Elon Musk."
Good 👍
Good app
The glories dumpster fire I hoped it wood be
Awesome 🤩
Absolutely great since Elon Musk took over and I appreciate the Twitter files being released.
