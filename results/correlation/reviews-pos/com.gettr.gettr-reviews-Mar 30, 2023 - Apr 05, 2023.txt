"Downgraded due to limits to size of videos. The lack of visibility. Postings seem isolated. I feel like I'm posting in a small room, exposure is not universal. I enjoy the free expression of the postings & responses. Americans must have opportunity to share perspectives. This is where the strengths of of nation manifest. Thank you GETTR!👍😇🇺🇸"
"Great insight and opinion for current events. Agree with the need for video background and restarting improvements. Need continuous play over other apps and / or resume at last point. Very tedious to find right vid again and restart where you stopped. Thought watching on Rumble vs the app might be a solution, but the vids did not seem to match."
Very informative and it's the truth
Smart good looking easy app to use.
I love using this app.
Great social media site that protects freedom of speech.
Felt like home upon arrival! 😆
Overall great app. It minds it's business until I open it up and then it does what I ask if it.
