people are review bombing this because they're mad but it's a ton of fun. it's still in beta so it's rough around the edges but there is no app with a better userbase than this. now if only the devs gave more invite codes
Just beat Twitter!
"The app doesn't open immediately when I open it on my tablet. I can only see the sky photo and I have to drag my fingers left and right, tap on the screen to finally see the 'what's next' screen. Please fix it."
Excellent
"The app is alright, it's similarity to Twitter isn't that intriguing but it's familiar which is a bonus in itself. My only worry is that since Jack Dorsey made this app, hopefully all the toxic and crazy leftists won't all migrate over. Its enough with the mad dog AOC"

Video preview doesn't show up when posting youtube links.
