Fair So Far
"Really enjoy not being censored. Enjoy reading about news that is otherwise censored everywhere. I don't like being controlled, manipulated, lied to, and disrespected to not be given my freedom to choose what I want to read and make up my own mind on anything. I have enough of that with Narcissist and codependent Parents."
Amazing app
"Android owner here, and I'm disappointed this app is still unavailable. Free speech is as American as Apple pie but censorship tastes like 💩! Get over it!"
I can't see people's comments I can't see my comments Is this censored?
Trump Social Is Being Blocked By The Liberal Woke Socialist Cancel Culture.
"4 stars because it's truly a place we can speak freely and not be restricted to primarily speech that supports only Dems & Libs. Conservatives and Repubs needed a space for their voices without being constantly censored by the likes of the awful Facebook and what Twitter was before Musk took over (thank goodness). The app works well, UI is nice and simple. My main complaint is that it runs in Chrome, and i really dislike Chrome (full of bugs). I hope they dev their own engine soon."
"Ignore haters. Yes it runs off chrome, but big whoop it doesn't cost money so there's no issue with that. Low reviews are just from disgruntled leftists."
Great app
Better than fakebook
Freedom of speech and privacy are priceless .. thank you Mr Trump sir ❤

I just got the app on my android phone. It just became available for me to download resently. I am very satisfied with the site and grateful to have a social media that doesn't censor me for my conservative &religious beliefs or take down stories I enjoy and like to go back and see again. Thank you so much!
