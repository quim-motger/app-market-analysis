Great
Very interactive and interesting app. Plenty of interaction with other users. Only bad thing I've found is all the disinformation this app allows by politicians
Quite infirmative
Gives you updates on anything happening around the world when ever you want and you can find things that you like and much much more.If you haven't downloaded it do it now or your missing out on a different world.
Nice app üëç
It would be good if you could hide posts you've already read.

I believe Musk bought Twitter out after the blueprint for Facebook meta went public. Twitter is not my most favorite social network nor will it ever be.
Excellent app
"I recommend making us change password cause prob some of us chose to sign up w/ our Gmail. cause when I signed up with my Gmail I didn't even know the pass,and it prob a random pass. Pls update Twitter with this update thank you. And I can't log in,so I recommend only adding ""email and user"" to make it easier."
Wow
"I Love this App,Cool!"

Twitter is a terrorist organization Twitter makes money by pedophiling children and centralizing adults forcing prostitutes to harass in public Twitter is nothing but a terrorist Al-Qaeda pornographic child abuse program.

"I have been a long time member, 2016, but I have some issues with them updating my community pages for other app sites On the Wizard of Oz community page is still back in 2016. My app of Bingo Blitz is right, it's dated for 2022. I wonder how many years it will be before the Wizard of OZ it gets updated?"
Good Play ‚èØÔ∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è
I really like this app.
Search
It keeps on lagging.
Bring back the shuffle button on the Playlists. This new version sucks. I used to like clicking on the shuffle button till i landed on a song I like. Now they only have a PLAY button. I don't need another play button on the same page. It doesn't make sense.
Wonderful experience
