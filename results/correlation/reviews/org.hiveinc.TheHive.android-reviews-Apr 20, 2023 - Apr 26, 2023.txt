Great user interface!!
"I really want to like this app. It's got some good features, including a strong NSFW guideline, but aldo....asks don't work. Mute doesn't work. DMs are a nightmare + there's no group chat function. And there's no desktop version. I'm keeping my account for now, but there's a lot of work needed to make this really usable."
Meh. The app is a little cumbersome. Slow to load and slow to update.
"This has great potential and could go really far - if it had a supportive algorithm. It's just hard to get noticed. I'm seeing it a lot with posts. We put hashtags but no one sees, likes or interacts with our posts. Everything else is great though, which is the only reason I'm not going lower with the rating. Please make it easier for hastags to find people who use similar ones. Idk how it works. I really hope this app goes a long way ❤️"
I had to close and reopen the app 5 times just to create an account because there'd always be a new bug on every step of the process.
It worked at first but now nothing loads except my profile and posts from months ago.
Consistent updates are really nice. Lots of great categories and subjects to explore. It's a chill vibe.
"App bugged while creating account, I cannot access my own account because is not finished. Reached support, no response."
Lots of progress has been made and alot of the functions are doing better hopefully they can keep this up all in all the app has been running much smoother then before.
"I really enjoyed myself during beta but unfortunately it seems that this app does not want to work for me, in any form."
I hope it sticks around. I see tons of potential in the format.
