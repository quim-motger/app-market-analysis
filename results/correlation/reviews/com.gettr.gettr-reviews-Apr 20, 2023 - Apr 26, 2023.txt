"DONT SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT THE CHINESE OR BORDER INVADERS, GETTR WILL BAN YOU. THIS IS JUST AS I SUSPECTED ABOUT GETTR."
"Gettr was like shouting into the wind. I'd post content daily but would hardly ever receive any interaction from anyone. The exact same post on Gab would garner dozens of likes, comments and reposts. Truth Social even has much better user interaction. I eventually deleted my Gettr account out of frustration. I would like to reinstate it and try again but Gettr doesn't allow reinstatement of deleted accounts."
Good social app.
"Edited my review back up to 4 stars. Super happy that with recent updates video progress is now bookmarked where if it is interrupted it resumes my place. I begged for that for awhile, so THANK YOU SO MUCH Gettr! There seems to be a glitch where all my favorite livestreams don't always show up in the livestream area, but missing episodes are easily found on the creator's direct page. Would ne nice to be able to subscribe to specific livestreams to appear in notifications."
Like the app but it doesn't always update automatically.
"Under new nazi management, the twitter employees that got fired went and stole the conservative twitter. People are talking trash in the gettr main profile about bans for speaking out against biden, you cant censor the truth as long as people know it. The spineless BS going on will stop."
LOVE it!!!
