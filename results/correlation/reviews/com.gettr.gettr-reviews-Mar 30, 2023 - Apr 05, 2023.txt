Smart good looking easy app to use.
When I open Gettr app ( only) it immediately closes. Turned off phone..no help. Deleted and reinstalled app no help. Ran antiviral app 100% ok....Sure wish I new how to fix this!!!
"Easy to use & a terrific way to watch live streams, or replay them later."
"Someone either working at gettr or hacking the site. & my phone, will close the app, before i can post or hit send, if i mention/list Rothschild relatives in-laws and or their actual admitted goals..."
Informative
"""Copy and Paste"" does not work. Cannot find saved drafts to copy and paste. Where are my ""drafts"""
Great social media site that protects freedom of speech.
Keeping informed and the outlook true.
Update seems to have broken the visions/Gtok
Awesome
"I'd like to give a big thumbs up! When I want, not just the facts, but others' opinions, I appreciate GETTR."

I love using this app.
Very informative and it's the truth
Super easy to use and no censorship!
I'm seeing improvements on bots
New to gettr
"Left Fakebook, Instagrab, Twittler (before Musk took over) to be here and not bad experience at all..."
Felt like home upon arrival! 😆
"Downgraded due to limits to size of videos. The lack of visibility. Postings seem isolated. I feel like I'm posting in a small room, exposure is not universal. I enjoy the free expression of the postings & responses. Americans must have opportunity to share perspectives. This is where the strengths of of nation manifest. Thank you GETTR!👍😇🇺🇸"
Overall great app. It minds it's business until I open it up and then it does what I ask if it.
Great app!

Like reading people's responses. I learn how connected we are.
"Great insight and opinion for current events. Agree with the need for video background and restarting improvements. Need continuous play over other apps and / or resume at last point. Very tedious to find right vid again and restart where you stopped. Thought watching on Rumble vs the app might be a solution, but the vids did not seem to match."
Great for free speech
