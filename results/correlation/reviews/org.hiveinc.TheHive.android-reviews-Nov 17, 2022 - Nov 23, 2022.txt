Has all the features a social media app needs and then some. Some really cool features on the way and the people working on it seem like great people unlike the incompetent moron running a certain other social media platform atm.
Blocking new registrations from my device with no explanation.
It's not Twitter. 10/10
"Everytime I try to sign up with an email, i get a message telling me the app has blocked messages from my device due to unusual activity. Guess I'm Uninstalling this app."
The app keeps crashing but other than that it's a good alternative to Twitter
"Liking it so far, really like the music bit, that'll be fun later on."
Love the app the only problem I have is that is does lag sometimes
Can't get past username screen
A truly safe space made by two guys with good intentions.
"This app has amazing potential and I'd love to use it more, but it's super slow and glitchy 🙃 hopefully it'll be fixed up and it can grow to something huge!"
This app is so cute. It's just at this moment it works slower. Maybe because a lot of people is signing up because of the controversy that Twitter will shutdown. I understand it because you said there's only 2 of you working on this. But this is good too when it's working hahaha.
"Really good app but it's way too slow, everything takes quite a bit to load Definitely worth a lot more than the current 3.2 stars in the app store though"
The app is kicking me out when clicking the search icon and there is lag. Looking forward for the fix on the android
The app doesn't support media on Android 13 so I have no way to do even basic functionality such as select a profile picture. The media permission is granted so there's something wrong with the app. It is unusable until they fix this issue
Crashes on me every few minutes. Makes my phone slow to the point where I can't use it. Took me multiple times to add a banner.
"I really have expectations in this app, but why i just can't select a profile and background picture. I have a hard time creating my account too."
The app doesnt work right at this time
"The idea is promising, tempting even! It's a new app, lots of development to do, yada yada, I'm just upset I can't change my profile photo. Also it's pretty dead at the moment, but it will probably gain more traction as another, bigger platform loses its fire"
"This is a great app! My only problem is when I choose dark mode and then when I reopen the app it goes back to light mode, so I had to switch to dark mode everytime I open the app."
says my email is already in use?? not off to a great start
This app crashes soooo much on my phone idk why because other apps run fine so it's getting a 2 star until I see improvements.
Slow and uncensored. But easy to use.
Needs work on making the vibe of the app feel more casual. Good luck to the designers!
Hummm i'm in!
First impressions I've had make me real happy. Only been a few bad things I've encountered so far. I can't seem to upload images from my phone storage for a pfp or a banner. I'd like a webpage version as well. Aside from those two things it's been smooth so far. I'll update this review if anything changes
Was amazing and exactly what I needed for a social media replacement.
"Doesn't allow signups, says my device isn't allowed to. Stock s21+. ?????"
Would be nice if i could add a profile pic or banner pic. Both options are blank when i tap on them to choose a photo. No photos show up for me to even choose. Ill change my star rating when i can actually use the app.
Can't create an account with email because password validation is broken.
"The developers have made it clear they do not have an interest in protecting your privacy or information, and their actions regarding this have been nothing but childish. DO NOT use a password you've used before or are using DO NOT use your real personal information this can be easily stolen DO NOT spread this platform around until it has been confirmed these issues are resolved. DO report these misconducts to the EU GDPR teams and other relevent countries Data protection teams."
"Fix the crashes on android,I can't even set a bio without crashing..lol"
"Overall I do like this app as an alternative to Twitter but I am having issues with updating my profile picture and posting images, I'm assuming its not picking up on my photo gallery?"
"Seems pretty cool so far! I first saw a couple of artists I followed on twitter moving here and tried so myself, so far it seems really nice and it's like a mix of twitter and Instagram which is pretty nice"
Posting and loading is so slow.
It has the makings of a great app but not just yet.
"Can't upload photos from my gallery. Uninstalled a few times, given permissions, etc. Still nothing. Can take new pictures to upload, but that's not very useful."
This is definitely the place to go to now that Twitter is being strangled. Lovely people all around <3
it doesn't work at all for android users.
Doesnt work at all hopefully they get a web app soon
unstable and very glitchy
I love the app I just installed it today and im enjoying it. I just hope users will be able to see the repost like on qoutes qrts on twt an also please put recent post on top cause im seeing old post on the hashtags
Won't even let me create a password so I can't even create an account in the first place. I don't want to use my phone number. I followed the password instructions exactly and it still won't let me use it no matter what. Disappointing.
Every username is taken
Set up was easy on Android but I cannot modify my profile pic. Cannot interact with the drop down arrow. I'm only allowed to take a picture. 😮‍💨😐
there's no username available? srsly? even i type everything i can from keyboard n it's still not availability for a uname? u should fix this fr
Give doesn't let me upload ANYTHING. I can post text but that's it. I work in visual media! Very disappointing.
"Yeah I can't select any photos for anything, it just doesn't give me the option, when I try to set a profile picture or banner or make a post it's basically just a black screen, there are a couple buttons but they do nothing. It would be nice if this was fixed."
"I can't sign up, I've tried phone number and email. the ""next"" buttons are greyed out even when I meet the requirements to move on."
Super laggy on my phone. Difficulty signing up as it gives incomplete error messages for password requirements.
1 star cuz why not
