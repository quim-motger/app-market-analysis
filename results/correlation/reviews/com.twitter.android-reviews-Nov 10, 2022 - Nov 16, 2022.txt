"I can't start a Spaces. The option to start a Spaces don't come up when I click the microphone button. I can join Spaces, but I can't create one."
Glad it was bought out. New times!!

Easy to use. Could do with more features as a whole like an edit button. Apart from that great. Always been a fan.
Elon Musk is incompetent and has killed Twitter.
Freedom & Civil Soap Box ! Thank You Elon!
Elon Musk is dumb af
I rate this app 3 star just coz of good social app but it drinks data like cold drink
Free Speach has won!
"buying verification defeats the entire purpose of verifying accounts, thanks for making it really difficult to find anything reliable on the app (which anything reliable was already hard to find) musk really making this app worse and worse"
Very good
Impressive
Nice app
"Came back after a four year break. I'm excited about having a full spectrum of people and views. So far, it has been great. Good conversations that represents all the sides!"
5 Stars Under Musk Leadership.
A beneficial and clear mind app ie. not like other apps in which we just have to keep scrolling and scrolling forever without a stop.
"Absolutely hate how its turned out since Elon bought it. Paid for verification? If your don't pay your posts won't reach anyone? I am never going to pay for a check, and if I have to pay to have my followers see my tweets I will just move sites. Theses are just a couple of my many grievances now. It worked just fine before, and could have used some updates in spots. But it didn't need a complete overhaul of function like this."
Thank you Elon for making free speech free again!
Under new management!
Informative
twitter blue is a thing

For Elon Musk ❤️

"I rarely rated any app but the only reason why I am rated this app is because of Elon Musk, I love you Man"

The best thing I have ever done was delete this app- the communities are awful and it breaks constantly.
