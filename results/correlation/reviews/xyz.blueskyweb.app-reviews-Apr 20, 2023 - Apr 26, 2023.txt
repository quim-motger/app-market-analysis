This app is garbage
Awesome.
Unfortunately I can't even get on the waitlist on android? It won't let me type in my email. Even going in a browser it's a endless screen I was hoping for this to be better than twitter.
Cool app Twitter alternative if you don't like twitter
Better than the look alike ✅🙌🏽
It says my email is invalid for no reason and the app is kinda slow and buggy. I really want to use this app but unfortunately I can't create an account. The developers should solve this problem for users like me to join.
Bluesky. Great App
Can't sign in or register maybe later keep working
I'm the first to rate this app All time history made for me Lovely app
Have downloaded the app but I would have to uninstall it because when I tried to sign up an error occurs saying my email is invalid
Good for social
First to rate ❤️ enjoying it already
"Fantastic just like old twitter, got some invite codes I'll give to friends"
"Non app requesting for invitation code after the inserting the it'll continue showing invite code not accepted, check that you input it correctly and try again."
What a way for democrats to ban free speech and spread propaganda 😂😂😂
"This App crashes so often, you cant upload media neither can you post a profile picture they better fix that"
Invite code BS! Useless instal 👎
"I don't have an invitation code, but it won't let me join the waitlist, either."
"on Samsung s8, I can't type in my email to join the waitlist. the keyboard pops up and then disappears right away every time I try to click on the text box. I'm sure it's a great app tho 🙃"
app does not reduce
Uganda 🇺🇬using bluesky
Good
Haven't tried it yet but it would be great
Nice App
I love this app 🔥🔥🔥 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Great. Let's make this work. (I was the first ever to comment)
"It won't let me sign up for the waitlist. When I tap to enter my email address, the keyboard slides up and instantly slides back down. Unable to type anything."
Is this the new Jack app to replace Twitter ? Elon musk is doing his thing as a businessman with twitter and it's going to ruin the app somehow If jack can come up with similar features I'm all in
TQ
Real good
Why invite only...
This isn't available for everyone.they want me to enter invite code
"Having installed the app, I'm still unable to sign up due to invite code. How can I get the invite code to get started"
The invite code ? Can't sign in without the invite code
The app is working well and I love that it's being constantly updated
"How do i get an invitation code please, i just newly installed it"
start fast i want to join
Poor connectivity
Someone please send me an invite
Please anyone share invite code?
Nice
Use bluesky instead of twitter
Please can I have an invite code
Twitter but with censorship
Well you have to be invited to be able to join. So I downloaded it for nothing. Before people download the app you should mention to download the app only if you have an invite code.
Es perfecto✨
Best app
It requires Sign up code
Not really felt the vibes of it. Currently on waitlist.
