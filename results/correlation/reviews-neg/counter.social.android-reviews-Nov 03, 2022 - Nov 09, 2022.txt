"I posted a couple of times. People seemed nice. I went back today, & found ""Access Denied."" There was some code to give to administrator, but that's above my ability. No gteat loss if they don't want me."
What's error code 1020?
"App won't even open. I just get an ""access denied"" warning."
Sucks. Won't let me access the app
"Horrible app. I got signed up and logged in. Then what? Nothing couldn't make it past the page after ""let's go"" maybe I'll try on my laptop but probably not. Android phone, Samsung Galaxy 10+"
Don't bother downloading this. It doesn't work.
"Can't access the app at all, tells me I'm not allowed."
"I can't register, it kept saying I have bad connection when I am already connected, it also kept saying ""bad gateway"" idk how to register and I'm having a hard time"
Blocked from accessing the app I assume because I'm in Thailand? Lol

"Total garbage, complete waste of time."
"Its very resource heavy and confusing UI, unstabel app"
When this app is installed and your phone is connected to wifi it drains your phone battery faster than normal. My battery went down 30% in the last 2 hours and I didn't even use the app to test this out. When the app is not installed phone battery is fine.
ERROR CODE 1020 ACCESS DENIED I UNINSTALLED AND AM OUT OF HERE!
"Not user friendly. I download it and immediately get told 1020 error, and I don't know how to fix it because I'm not that tech savvy. I really like the concept of this place and would like to be a part of it."
"I just downloaded this and I can't post anything. I write something and hit ""post"" and absolutely nothing happens. I also get a lot of bad gateway messages when trying to load another page, like my profile. Hopefully this is just a weird hiccup."
